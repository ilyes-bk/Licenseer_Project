\section{Conclusions}
\label{Section:Conclusions}

\textcolor{black}{This paper presents LARK (License Analysis with RAG and Knowledge graphs), a novel framework that addresses critical challenges in software license compatibility detection and regulatory compliance. Modern software development increasingly relies on complex ecosystems of open-source components, where 72.91\% of projects encounter license incompatibilities that threaten project viability and regulatory compliance. Our methodology integrates Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation to provide comprehensive license compatibility analysis with explainable reasoning.

\textbf{Technical Contributions:} Our framework makes several key technical contributions: (1) \textit{Integrated Knowledge Representation} through Neo4j-based knowledge graphs that model 750+ licenses, 20,000+ dependencies, and their compatibility relationships enabling transitive analysis across complex dependency chains; (2) \textit{LLM-Powered Custom License Integration} using GPT-4 with few-shot learning to automatically parse and integrate novel license texts without requiring model retraining; (3) \textit{RAG-Enhanced Explainability} that provides detailed, citation-backed explanations with 92.8\% retrieval precision from 25,000+ indexed segments across comprehensive legal literature including authoritative books, IEEE/ACM articles, and regulatory guidelines, providing 3.2x more citations than existing approaches with exact page numbers and section references; (4) \textit{Dual-Constraint Hallucination Mitigation} through knowledge graph constraints that prevent LLM decision-making and RAG grounding that ensures all explanations reference authoritative legal sources, achieving 2.1\% hallucination rate compared to 18.7\% for unconstrained LLM responses; (5) \textit{Dynamic Update Capabilities} supporting rapid adaptation to evolving legal interpretations through graph-based knowledge representation.

\textbf{Experimental Validation:} Our comprehensive evaluation on 4,000 OSS projects demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches. LARK achieves (1) 98.1\% license detection accuracy compared to 93.2\% for LiDetector; (2) 96.2\% conflict detection F1 score versus 88.7\% for baselines; (3) 4.8/5 explainability score compared to 3.2/5 for existing tools; (4) 94\% accuracy in processing custom and proprietary licenses where traditional tools provide 23\% capability; (5) 2.1\% hallucination rate compared to 18.7\% for unconstrained LLM responses, with 97.8\% verifiable citations; (6) 24-hour update cycles versus 168 hours for ML-based approaches; (7) 0.32GB memory usage representing 71\% reduction compared to existing systems.

\textbf{Practical Impact:} The framework addresses critical gaps in existing approaches: limited explainability in current tools, static knowledge representation requiring manual updates, narrow compatibility analysis focus, and poor custom license handling. LARK provides citation-backed explanations essential for regulatory compliance, supports automatic integration of custom licenses, and enables real-time compatibility monitoring through CI/CD integration.

\textbf{Future Work:} We plan to extend coverage to emerging license formats, integrate additional package managers, develop regulatory framework-specific policies (GDPR, CCPA), and create industry-specific knowledge graphs for domain-specific compliance requirements. Further research directions include fine-tuning specialized legal LLMs, developing temporal license evolution models, and exploring multi-modal analysis combining license text with code patterns.

We believe that our results contribute to a significant advancement in automated license compatibility detection, providing developers and organizations with accurate, explainable, and scalable solutions for legal risk mitigation and regulatory compliance in modern software engineering.
