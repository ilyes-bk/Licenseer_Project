This license may be particularly\nsuitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but\nit is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is\nunrelated to TeX.\nThe section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE’,\nbelow, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors\nwho are considering distributing their works under this license.\nThis license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed\nand modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of\nthat work may be distributed.\nWe, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you the\nfreedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that\nconform with whatever technical specifications you wish while\nmaintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that\nwork. If you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these\nconditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex’ and `modguide.tex’\nin the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.\nDEFINITIONS\nIn this license document the following terms are used:\n`Work’\nAny work being distributed under this License.\n`Derived Work’\nAny work that under any applicable law is derived from the\nWork.\n`Modification’\nAny procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable\nlaw — for example, the production of a file containing an\noriginal file associated with the Work or a significant portion of\nsuch a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\ninto another language.\n`Modify’\nTo apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any\napplicable law.\n`Distribution’\nMaking copies of the Work available from one person to another, in\nwhole or in part. Distribution includes (but is not limited to)\nmaking any electronic components of the Work accessible by file\ntransfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file systems\nsuch as Sun’s Network File System (NFS).\n`Compiled Work’\nA version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it\nis directly usable on a computer system. This processing may include\nusing installation facilities provided by the Work, transformations\nof the Work, copying of components of the Work, or other\nactivities. Note that modification of any installation facilities\nprovided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.\n`Current Maintainer’\nA person or persons nominated as such within the Work. If there is\nno such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder’ under\nany applicable law.\n`Base Interpreter’\nA program or process that is normally needed for running or\ninterpreting a part or the whole of the Work.A Base Interpreter may\ndepend on external components but these are not considered part of\nthe Base Interpreter provided that each external component clearly\nidentifies itself whenever it is used interactively. Unless\nexplicitly specified when applying the license to the Work, the only\napplicable Base Interpreter is a\n`LaTeX-Format’ or in the case of files belonging to the\n`LaTeX-format’ a program implementing the `TeX language’.\nCONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\nActivities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work\nare not covered by this license; they are outside its scope. In\nparticular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no\nrequirements are made concerning any offers of support for the\nWork.\nYou may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you\nreceived it. Distribution of only part of the Work is considered\nmodification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived\nWork may be assumed under the terms of this clause.\nYou may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a\ncomplete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2\nabove, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way\nthat the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system\nexactly as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled\nWork directly from the Work.\nIf you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without\nrestriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work. You may\nalso distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including\nCompiled Works generated from the Derived Work. Derived Works\ndistributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered\nto be updated versions of the Work.\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify\nyour copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the\nWork, and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work\nbased on the Derived Work.\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met\nfor every component of the Work unless that component clearly states\nin the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition. Only\nthe Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of\nexemption to a component of the Work.\nIf a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement\nfor a component of the Work when that component is used with the\nBase Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work\nidentifies itself to the user when used interactively with that\nBase Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work\nclearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version\nof this component to the user when used interactively with that\nBase Interpreter.\nEvery component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices\ndetailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a\nprominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of\nthe Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log of\nthe changes.\nNo information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,\nincluding (but not limited to) the authors of the original version\nof the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)\nthe reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the Derived\nWork unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do\nprovide such support for the Derived Work.\nYou distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:\nA complete, unmodified copy of the Work; if your distribution\nof a modified component is made by offering access to copy the\nmodified component from a designated place, then offering\nequivalent access to copy the Work from the same or some similar\nplace meets this condition, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the Work along with the modified\ncomponent;\nInformation that is sufficient to obtain a complete,\nunmodified copy of the Work.\nIf you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may\ndistribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as\nthe Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled\nWork, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met\nwith regard to the Derived Work.\nThe conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do\nnot apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so\nthat it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of\nthe Work as it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under\nClause 4, above.\nDistribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative\nformat, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is\nthen produced by applying some process to that format, does not\nrelax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the\nresults of applying that process.\nA Derived Work may be distributed under a different license\nprovided that license itself honors the conditions listed in\nClause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not\nhave to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.\nIf a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that\nDerived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of\nitself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the\nrestrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the\nWork.\nThis license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to\nthe Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on\naggregating such works with the Work by any means.\nNothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent\ncomplete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.\nNO WARRANTY\nThere is no warranty for the Work. Except when otherwise stated in\nwriting, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is’, without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not\nlimited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for\na particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and\nperformance of the Work is with you. Should the Work prove defective,\nyou assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.\nIn no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing\nwill The Copyright Holder, or\nany author named in the components of the Work, or any other party who\nmay distribute and/or modify the Work as permitted above, be liable to\nyou for damages, including any general, special, incidental or\nconsequential damages arising out of any use of the Work or out of\ninability to use the Work (including, but not limited to, loss of\ndata, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as\na result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other\nprograms), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other\nparty has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\nMAINTENANCE OF THE WORK\nThe Work has the status `author-maintained’ if the Copyright Holder\nexplicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in\nthe Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder\nor simply that it is `author-maintained’.\nThe Work has the status `maintained’ if there is a Current Maintainer\nwho has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error\nreports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail\naddress). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge\nor act upon these error reports.\nThe Work changes from status `maintained’ to `unmaintained’ if there\nis no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current\nMaintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means\nof communication for a period of six months, and there are no other\nsignificant signs of active maintenance.\nYou can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with\nany existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.\nIf the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of\nthe Work through the following steps:\nMake a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and the\nCopyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of an\nInternet or similar search.\nIf this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work is\nstill maintained.\nIf it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer to\nupdate their communication data within one month.\nIf the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active\nmaintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce\nwithin the pertinent community your intention to take over\nmaintenance. (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be done, for\nexample, by posting to comp.text.tex.)\nIf the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass\nmaintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect immediately\nupon announcement.\nIf the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright\nHolder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you, then\nthis takes effect immediately upon announcement.\nIf you make an `intention announcement’ as described in 2b. above\nand after three months your intention is challenged neither by the\nCurrent Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other people,\nthen you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as to name you as\nthe (new) Current Maintainer.\nIf the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes reachable\nonce more within three months of a change completed under the terms\nof 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must become or remain the\nCurrent Maintainer upon request provided they then update their\ncommunication data within one month.\nA change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact\nthat the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.\nIf you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should\nimmediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous\nstatement of your status as Current Maintainer. You should also\nannounce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b)\nabove.\nWHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS\nLICENSE\nThis section contains important instructions, examples, and\nrecommendations for authors who are considering distributing their\nworks under this license. These authors are addressed as `you’ in this\nsection.\nChoosing This License or Another License\nIf for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*\nconditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then\ndo not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,\ndistribute your work under a different license. You may use the text\nof this license as a model for your own license, but your license\nshould not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that\nyour work is distributed under the LPPL.\nThe document `modguide.tex’ in the base LaTeX distribution explains\nthe motivation behind the conditions of this license. It explains, for\nexample, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public License\n(GPL) was considered inappropriate. Even if your work is unrelated to\nLaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex’ may still be relevant, and\nauthors intending to distribute their works under any license are\nencouraged to read it.\nA Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution\nIt is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own\npersonal use, without also meeting the above conditions for\ndistributing the modified component. While you might intend that such\nmodifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by\naccident — you may forget that you have modified that component;\nor it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified\nversion that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions\nof this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,\ncause problems for the community. It is therefore usually in your best\ninterest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public\none. Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work\nwithout altering any of its licensed components.\nHow to Use This License\nTo use this license, place in each of the components of your work both\nan explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work\nwas authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a\nstatement that the distribution and/or modification of that component\nis constrained by the conditions in this license.\nHere is an example of such a notice and statement:\n  %% pig.dtx\n  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name\n  %\n  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the\n  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3\n  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.\n  % The latest version of this license is in\n  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt\n  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX\n  % version 2005/12/01 or later.\n  %\n  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.\n  % \n  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.\n  %\n  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins\n  % and the derived file pig.sty.\nGiven such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in\nthis license document would apply, with the `Work’ referring to the\nthree files `pig.dtx’, `pig.ins’, and `pig.sty’ (the last being\ngenerated from `pig.dtx’ using `pig.ins’), the `Base Interpreter’\nreferring to any `LaTeX-Format’, and both `Copyright Holder’ and\n`Current Maintainer’ referring to the person `M. Y. Name’.\nIf you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your\nWork, change `maintained’ above into `author-maintained’. However, we\nrecommend that you use `maintained’, as the Maintenance section was\nadded in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to the\ncommunity even when you can no longer maintain and support it\nyourself.\nDerived Works That Are Not Replacements\nSeveral clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and\nstability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves\nwith the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a\n(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If\nthis is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a\ncompletely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.\nImportant Recommendations\nDefining What Constitutes the Work\nThe LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the files\nof the Work. It is therefore important that you provide a way for the\nlicensee to determine which files constitute the Work. This could, for\nexample, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the Work\nnear the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as:\n    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.\nin that place. In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be\nimpossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to\ncomprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled\nto make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the Work."
