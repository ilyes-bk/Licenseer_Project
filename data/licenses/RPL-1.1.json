If You initiate\nlitigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding\ndeclaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor\n(Licensor or Contributor against whom You file such an action is\nreferred to herein as “Respondent”) alleging that Licensed Software\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights\ngranted by such Respondent to You under Sections 3 or 4 of this License\nshall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from\nRespondent (the “Notice Period”) unless within that Notice Period You\neither agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable\nreasonably royalty for Your past or future use of Licensed Software made\nby such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect\nto Licensed Software against such Respondent. If within said Notice\nPeriod a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually\nagreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not\nwithdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to You under Sections 3 and 4\nautomatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.\n12.3 Reasonable Value of This License.
