    "content": "Preamble\nCERN has developed this licence to promote collaboration among\nhardware designers and to provide a legal tool which supports the\nfreedom to use, study, modify, share and distribute hardware designs\nand products based on those designs. Version 2 of the CERN Open\nHardware Licence comes in three variants: this licence, CERN-OHL-P\n(permissive); and two reciprocal licences: CERN-OHL-W (weakly\nreciprocal) and CERN-OHL-S (strongly reciprocal).\nThe CERN-OHL-P is copyright CERN 2020. Anyone is welcome to use it, in\nunmodified form only.\nUse of this Licence does not imply any endorsement by CERN of any\nLicensor or their designs nor does it imply any involvement by CERN in\ntheir development.\n1 Definitions\n1.1 ‘Licence’ means this CERN-OHL-P.\n1.2 ‘Source’ means information such as design materials or digital\ncode which can be applied to Make or test a Product or to\nprepare a Product for use, Conveyance or sale, regardless of its\nmedium or how it is expressed. It may include Notices.\n1.3 ‘Covered Source’ means Source that is explicitly made available\nunder this Licence.\n1.4 ‘Product’ means any device, component, work or physical object,\nwhether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use,\napplication or processing of Covered Source.\n1.5 ‘Make’ means to create or configure something, whether by\nmanufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered\nSource or another Product or otherwise.\n1.6 ‘Notice’ means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices,\nreferences to the location of any Notices, modification notices\n(subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence\nand to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the\nCovered Source.\n1.7 ‘Licensee’ or ‘You’ means any person exercising rights under\nthis Licence.\n1.8 ‘Licensor’ means a person who creates Source or modifies Covered\nSource and subsequently Conveys the resulting Covered Source\nunder the terms and conditions of this Licence. A person may be\na Licensee and a Licensor at the same time.\n1.9 ‘Convey’ means to communicate to the public or distribute.\n2 Applicability\n2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying\nof Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By\nexercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably\naccept these terms and conditions.\n2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and\nshall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.\n2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the\nrights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.\n2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing,\nor any other similar right.\n3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source\n3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in\nany medium, provided You retain all Notices.\n3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices.\nYou may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to\nthe corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may\nadd additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.\n3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You\nshall also become a Licensor) provided that You:\na) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2; and\nb) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You\nhave modified it, with the date and brief description of how\nYou have modified it.\n3.4 You may Convey Covered Source or modified Covered Source under\nlicence terms which differ from the terms of this Licence\nprovided that You:\na) comply at all times with subsection 3.3; and\nb) provide a copy of this Licence to anyone to whom You\nConvey Covered Source or modified Covered Source.\n4 Making and Conveying Products\nYou may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You ensure\nthat the recipient of the Product has access to any Notices applicable\nto the Product.\n5 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\n5.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY — The Covered Source and any Products\nare provided ‘as is’ and any express or implied warranties,\nincluding, but not limited to, implied warranties of\nmerchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of\nthird party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use\nare disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the\nmaximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no\nrepresentation that any Source or Product does not or will not\ninfringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other\nproprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and\nperformance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not\nthe Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part\nof this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights\ngranted under this Licence.\n5.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY — The Licensor shall, to\nthe maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for\ndirect, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary,\npunitive or other damages of any character including, without\nlimitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of\nuse, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused\nand on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including\nnegligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way\nin relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source\nand/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of\nthe possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the\nLicensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs,\ndamages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties,\nin relation to such use.\n6 Patents\n6.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each\nLicensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,\nnon-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as\nstated in this section 6, or where terminated by the Licensor\nfor cause) patent licence to Make, have Made, use, offer to\nsell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source\nand Products, where such licence applies only to those patent\nclaims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily\ninfringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as\nConveyed by that Licensor.\n6.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including\na cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nCovered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory\npatent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent\nlicensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable\nthen any rights granted to You under this Licence shall\nterminate as of the date such process is initiated.\n7 General\n7.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become\ninvalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining\nprovisions shall remain effective.\n7.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and\nabbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is\nknown, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where\nthe use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use\nshall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind\nof endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or\nits personnel.\n7.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence\nwhich it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns. New\nversions will be published with a unique version number and a\nvariant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has\nspecified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source\nwithout specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source\nas being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that\nvariant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be\ntreated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may\nalso specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific\nversion of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You\nmay apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same\nvariant identifier published by CERN.\n7.4 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor\nacting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are\nspecifically excluded."
