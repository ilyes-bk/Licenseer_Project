\begin{abstract}
Open-source software (OSS) projects frequently integrate multiple dependencies, each subject to a different license. These licenses may impose conflicting obligations and restrictions, leading to \emph{license incompatibilities} that not only threaten project viability but also impede regulatory compliance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a \textbf{Knowledge Graph (KG)} with \textbf{Large Language Models (LLMs)} and a \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)} mechanism to automate the detection of potential incompatibilities and provide context-rich, citation-backed explanations. Our framework addresses both \emph{public licenses}—with a structured compatibility matrix and graph-based relationships—and \emph{custom or private licenses} parsed via an LLM and integrated into the KG. Furthermore, we discuss how our solution supports regulatory compliance by enabling traceability, continuous updates, and integration with CI/CD pipelines. Empirical evaluation on a dataset of 2,000 OSS projects demonstrates higher accuracy, faster updates, and enhanced explainability. Our results indicate that the proposed KG+LLM+RAG framework not only mitigates legal risks but also provides a scalable, extensible solution for regulatory compliance in software engineering.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Modern software development increasingly depends on open-source components. Projects often integrate dozens or even hundreds of third-party libraries, each governed by licenses such as MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, or various custom and proprietary variants. Recent studies indicate that \textbf{72.91\%} of OSS projects encounter some form of license incompatibility \cite{vendome2017license}, which may lead to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Legal Liability:} Violations of copyleft requirements or patent clauses.
    \item \textbf{Restricted Distribution:} Conflicts that prevent the lawful distribution of combined software.
    \item \textbf{Complex Compliance:} Increased efforts to track, reconcile, and disclose licensing terms in line with regulatory requirements.
\end{itemize}

Beyond legal risks, such incompatibilities can hinder compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks in software engineering. As governments and industry bodies impose standards—ranging from data privacy to safety and security—ensuring that software artifacts adhere to both legal licenses and regulatory mandates becomes critical. Traditional methods relying on manual reviews or static rule-based tools are inadequate due to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The sheer volume and diversity of licenses (over 200 recognized by OSI and SPDX).
    \item Nuanced, version-specific differences (e.g., GPLv2 vs.\ GPLv3).
    \item The need for continuous updates in a dynamic regulatory environment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Our Contribution.} We introduce a \textbf{Knowledge Graph (KG)} and \textbf{Large Language Model (LLM)}-driven approach for license compatibility analysis that directly supports regulatory compliance by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Graph:} Encoding known public licenses, dependencies, and their relationships (e.g., \texttt{COMPATIBLE\_WITH}, \texttt{INCOMPATIBLE\_WITH}) to enable traceability and change impact analysis.
    \item \textbf{LLM-based Parsing:} Handling \emph{custom or private licenses} by extracting key obligations and prohibitions, updating the KG with new terms without requiring model retraining.
    \item \textbf{RAG for Explainability:} Providing detailed, citation-backed explanations that retrieve relevant legal texts and regulatory guidelines.
\end{enumerate}
In addition to comparing our system to \textbf{LiDetector}, we discuss integration scenarios such as embedding our pipeline in CI/CD workflows for real-time regulatory compliance monitoring.

\section{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{License Compliance vs. Compatibility}
Understanding the distinction between license \emph{compliance} and \emph{compatibility} is fundamental to effective software license management. While these terms are often used interchangeably, they represent distinct concepts with different implications for software development and distribution.

\subsubsection{License Compliance}
License compliance refers to adherence to the specific terms, conditions, and obligations outlined in a software license. This encompasses several key dimensions:

\textbf{Obligation Fulfillment:} Compliance requires satisfying all mandatory requirements specified by a license, including attribution requirements, source code disclosure obligations, patent grants, and distribution restrictions. For instance, the GPL family of licenses mandates that derivative works must also be licensed under compatible terms, while permissive licenses like MIT require preservation of copyright notices.

\textbf{Procedural Adherence:} Beyond substantive requirements, compliance involves following prescribed procedures for license notification, documentation, and disclosure. This includes maintaining accurate license inventories, providing appropriate notices to end users, and ensuring proper attribution in derivative works.

\textbf{Temporal Considerations:} License compliance is not a one-time determination but requires ongoing monitoring as software evolves. Dependencies may change, license terms may be updated, and new regulatory requirements may emerge, necessitating continuous compliance assessment.

\subsubsection{License Compatibility}
License compatibility, in contrast, addresses whether different licenses can coexist within a single software project or distribution. This involves several analytical dimensions:

\textbf{Directional Compatibility:} License compatibility is often asymmetric. For example, MIT-licensed code can be incorporated into GPL projects, but GPL code cannot be included in MIT-licensed projects due to the GPL's copyleft requirements. This directional nature requires careful consideration of the dependency graph and integration patterns.

\textbf{Compatibility Classes:} Licenses can be categorized into broad compatibility classes: permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD) generally offer high compatibility with other licenses; weak copyleft licenses (LGPL, MPL) allow linking with proprietary code under specific conditions; strong copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL) impose strict requirements on derivative works and combinations.

\textbf{Integration Context:} Compatibility depends heavily on how different licensed components interact. Static linking, dynamic linking, and service-oriented architectures each present different compatibility considerations. For instance, the LGPL permits dynamic linking with proprietary code while prohibiting static linking under certain conditions.

\subsubsection{Compliance-Compatibility Interplay}
The relationship between compliance and compatibility creates complex analytical challenges. A project may achieve compatibility between individual license pairs while failing overall compliance due to conflicting obligations. Conversely, strict compliance with individual licenses may create compatibility conflicts when multiple dependencies are considered holistically.

Our framework addresses both dimensions by modeling compliance requirements as knowledge graph relationships while assessing compatibility through graph traversal algorithms that consider the full dependency context.

\subsection{Large Language Models for Legal Text Analysis}

The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to legal text processing has emerged as a transformative approach for handling the complexity and nuance inherent in legal documents. Our framework leverages several LLM adaptation techniques to achieve robust license analysis capabilities.

\subsubsection{Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning}
Zero-shot learning enables LLMs to perform tasks without task-specific training examples, relying instead on the model's pre-trained knowledge and carefully constructed prompts. In license analysis, zero-shot approaches excel at identifying standard legal concepts and obligations that appear consistently across license texts, such as attribution requirements, distribution restrictions, and warranty disclaimers.

However, zero-shot performance often degrades when confronting domain-specific terminology or novel license structures. Few-shot learning addresses this limitation by providing a small number of exemplars within the prompt, enabling the model to adapt to specific license analysis patterns. Our inference pipeline employs few-shot learning for custom license parsing, where providing 2-3 examples of parsed license clauses significantly improves extraction accuracy for obligations, prohibitions, and permissions.

The choice between zero-shot and few-shot approaches depends on several factors: license standardization (standard licenses favor zero-shot), terminology novelty (custom licenses benefit from few-shot), and computational constraints (zero-shot requires less prompt engineering overhead). Our system dynamically selects the appropriate approach based on license classification confidence scores.

\subsubsection{Prompt Engineering for Legal Analysis}
Effective prompt engineering for legal text analysis requires careful consideration of legal reasoning patterns and terminology precision. Unlike general text processing, legal analysis demands explicit attention to:

\textbf{Contextual Precision:} Legal terms often have specific meanings that differ from common usage. Prompts must provide sufficient context to ensure accurate interpretation while avoiding ambiguity that could lead to misclassification.

\textbf{Structured Output Requirements:} Legal analysis requires structured outputs that can be integrated into downstream processing systems. Our prompts specify JSON schemas for extracted obligations, enabling direct integration with the knowledge graph construction pipeline.

\textbf{Confidence Calibration:} Legal analysis demands high confidence in extracted information due to potential compliance consequences. Our prompts include confidence scoring instructions, enabling the system to flag uncertain extractions for human review.

\textbf{Multi-Step Reasoning:} Complex license analysis often requires multi-step reasoning processes. Our prompt engineering approach decomposes complex analysis tasks into sequential steps, enabling more reliable and interpretable outcomes.

\subsubsection{Fine-Tuning Approaches}
While prompt engineering provides flexibility and rapid deployment, fine-tuning offers superior performance for specialized legal analysis tasks. However, traditional fine-tuning approaches present significant resource requirements and adaptation challenges.

\textbf{Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):} LoRA addresses fine-tuning resource constraints by learning low-rank decompositions of weight updates rather than modifying full model parameters. This approach reduces memory requirements by up to 90\% while maintaining competitive performance. For license analysis, LoRA enables efficient adaptation to domain-specific terminology and reasoning patterns without requiring extensive computational infrastructure.

\textbf{Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA):} QLoRA extends LoRA benefits by incorporating quantization techniques that further reduce memory requirements. By representing model weights in reduced precision formats (typically 4-bit), QLoRA enables fine-tuning of large language models on consumer hardware while preserving performance quality. This democratization of fine-tuning capabilities is particularly valuable for specialized domains like legal analysis where custom model adaptation may be necessary.

Although our current implementation relies primarily on prompt engineering and few-shot learning for flexibility and deployment simplicity, our architecture supports integration of LoRA and QLoRA fine-tuned models for organizations requiring specialized legal analysis capabilities.

\subsection{Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems}
Retrieval-Augmented Generation represents a paradigm shift in language model applications, combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with the factual grounding provided by external knowledge sources. For license compatibility analysis, RAG systems address several critical challenges:

\subsubsection{Knowledge Base Construction}
Effective RAG systems require carefully constructed knowledge bases that balance comprehensiveness with retrieval efficiency. Our approach employs multiple knowledge base construction strategies:

\textbf{Document Segmentation:} License texts undergo semantic segmentation to create coherent chunks that preserve legal context while enabling precise retrieval. We employ recursive character splitting with legal structure awareness, ensuring that related clauses remain grouped while maintaining retrievable granularity.

\textbf{Metadata Enrichment:} Each document chunk includes rich metadata encompassing license identifiers, categorization information, effective dates, and legal precedence relationships. This metadata enables both semantic and structured retrieval approaches.

\textbf{Multi-Modal Indexing:} Our knowledge base incorporates both dense semantic embeddings for conceptual similarity and sparse keyword indices for exact term matching. This hybrid approach ensures both broad conceptual retrieval and precise legal term identification.

\subsubsection{Retrieval Mechanisms}
The retrieval component of RAG systems significantly impacts both the relevance and diversity of retrieved information. Our implementation employs several retrieval enhancement techniques:

\textbf{Query Expansion:} Legal queries often benefit from expansion with synonymous terms and related concepts. Our system employs knowledge graph relationships to expand queries with semantically related legal terms, improving recall without sacrificing precision.

\textbf{Contextual Filtering:} Retrieval results undergo contextual filtering based on license categories, version specificity, and jurisdiction relevance. This filtering reduces noise and improves the relevance of retrieved information for specific compatibility analysis tasks.

\textbf{Temporal Awareness:} License interpretations and compatibility relationships evolve over time. Our retrieval system incorporates temporal scoring that favors recent legal interpretations while maintaining access to historical context when relevant.

\subsubsection{Generation Enhancement}
The generation component of RAG systems must balance factual accuracy with explanatory clarity. Our approach incorporates several generation enhancement strategies:

\textbf{Citation Integration:} Generated explanations include precise citations to source documents, enabling verification and supporting audit requirements. Citation formatting follows legal standards, providing page numbers, section references, and publication details where applicable.

\textbf{Confidence Indicators:} Generated explanations include confidence indicators based on retrieval relevance scores and generation model uncertainty estimates. This enables users to assess the reliability of automated analysis results.

\textbf{Multi-Perspective Synthesis:} When multiple retrieved documents provide differing perspectives on compatibility questions, our generation process synthesizes these viewpoints while explicitly acknowledging areas of uncertainty or disagreement.

\subsection{Knowledge Graphs in Legal Analysis}
Knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing complex legal relationships and enabling sophisticated reasoning over legal knowledge. The application of knowledge graphs to license analysis offers several distinct advantages over traditional approaches.

\subsubsection{Graph-Based Legal Representation}
Legal relationships exhibit inherent graph-like properties that align naturally with knowledge graph representations. In the context of software licensing, these relationships manifest across multiple dimensions:

\textbf{Hierarchical License Families:} Many licenses exist within hierarchical families sharing common ancestry and similar obligations. The GPL family, for instance, includes GPLv1, GPLv2, and GPLv3, each building upon predecessor versions while introducing specific modifications. Knowledge graphs can model these hierarchical relationships explicitly, enabling inheritance-based reasoning and version-specific compatibility analysis.

\textbf{Cross-License Dependencies:} License compatibility often depends on complex inter-license relationships that extend beyond simple pairwise comparisons. For example, the compatibility of a three-license combination (MIT + Apache 2.0 + LGPL) requires understanding the transitive compatibility relationships among all three licenses. Graph traversal algorithms can efficiently identify such multi-hop relationships.

\textbf{Temporal Evolution:} License interpretations and compatibility relationships evolve over time due to legal precedents, community consensus, and regulatory changes. Knowledge graphs can model temporal aspects through versioned relationships and time-stamped compatibility assertions, enabling historical analysis and trend identification.

\subsubsection{Ontological Foundations}
Effective legal knowledge graphs require robust ontological foundations that capture the semantic structure of legal concepts. Our approach builds upon established legal ontologies while extending them for software license analysis:

\textbf{Legal Concept Hierarchy:} We employ a hierarchical taxonomy of legal concepts ranging from abstract principles (copyleft, attribution) to specific obligations (source disclosure, patent grants). This hierarchy enables both precise and abstract reasoning over license requirements.

\textbf{Obligation Modeling:} License obligations are modeled as first-class entities with associated properties including scope (entire work vs. modifications), triggers (distribution vs. use), and temporal constraints (immediate vs. deferred). This detailed modeling enables precise compatibility analysis.

\textbf{Permission and Prohibition Networks:} Beyond simple compatibility assertions, our knowledge graph models the underlying permissions and prohibitions that determine compatibility. This approach enables explanation generation and supports reasoning about novel license combinations.

\subsubsection{Graph Construction and Maintenance}
The construction and maintenance of comprehensive legal knowledge graphs presents several technical and methodological challenges:

\textbf{Automated Knowledge Extraction:} While manual curation ensures accuracy, the scale and evolution rate of software licenses necessitates automated knowledge extraction. Our approach combines rule-based extraction for standard license patterns with LLM-based extraction for novel or custom licenses.

\textbf{Consistency Maintenance:} Legal knowledge graphs must maintain consistency across potentially conflicting sources of legal information. We employ constraint satisfaction techniques and expert validation workflows to identify and resolve inconsistencies.

\textbf{Incremental Updates:} As new licenses emerge and legal interpretations evolve, knowledge graphs must support efficient incremental updates. Our architecture employs change propagation algorithms that identify and update affected compatibility relationships when new information is added.

\subsubsection{Graph-Based Reasoning}
Knowledge graphs enable sophisticated reasoning capabilities that extend beyond simple lookup operations:

\textbf{Transitive Compatibility Analysis:} Graph traversal algorithms can identify compatibility paths through multi-license dependency chains, enabling analysis of complex software compositions.

\textbf{Conflict Detection:} By modeling contradictory obligations as negative relationships, graph algorithms can efficiently identify potential conflicts even in large dependency networks.

\textbf{Impact Analysis:} When license terms change or new interpretations emerge, graph-based reasoning can identify all potentially affected projects and dependencies, enabling proactive compliance management.

\subsection{Open-Source Licensing Challenges}
The complexity of OSS licensing has been extensively studied in recent years. Vendome et al. \cite{vendome2017license} analyzed license usage and changes in 16,221 Java projects, highlighting the prevalence of license incompatibilities. German and Hassan \cite{german2009license} examined license conflicts in code reuse scenarios, finding that developers often unknowingly introduce incompatibilities. Wu et al. \cite{wu2017empirical} conducted an empirical study on the impact of licensing on software project success, demonstrating correlations between license choice and project adoption.

The increasing use of microservices and container-based architectures further complicates licensing, as highlighted by Lerner and Tirole \cite{lerner2002simple}. Their economic analysis of open-source licensing demonstrates how license choices affect project sustainability and commercial viability. Recent work by Kapitsaki et al. \cite{kapitsaki2017licenses} developed taxonomies for classifying licenses based on their restrictions and permissions, which inform our KG structure.

\subsection{Existing Tools for License Analysis}
A variety of tools exist for OSS license analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ninka} \cite{german2010sentence}: A rule-based scanner for identifying licenses via textual pattern matching, achieving 93\% accuracy on standard licenses but struggling with variations and custom text.
    \item \textbf{FOSSology} \cite{fossology}: An extensible framework for scanning, analyzing, and reporting on OSS license compliance, widely adopted in enterprise settings.
    \item \textbf{ScanCode} \cite{scancode}: A comprehensive scanning tool that detects licenses, copyrights, and dependencies in code, with growing industry adoption.
    \item \textbf{LiDetector} \cite{LiDetectorPaper}: Employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) to detect conflicting license terms.
\end{itemize}
While effective in large-scale scanning, these methods often lack detailed \emph{explainability} and struggle with custom licenses or updates—critical aspects in regulatory compliance.

Recent applications of KGs in legal domains have shown promising results. Fallatah et al. \cite{fallatah2020ontology} developed an ontology for representing license terms, while Leone et al. \cite{leone2020legal} demonstrated how knowledge graphs can model complex legal relationships and support automated reasoning.

Brack et al. \cite{brack2021knowledge} explored how KGs enhance explainability in legal AI systems—a key consideration for regulatory compliance. Their work shows that graph-based representations provide transparency that is lacking in black-box models, making KGs particularly suitable for legal applications where interpretability is crucial.

Recent work by Gao et al. \cite{gao2023retrieval} has shown that RAG significantly outperforms standard LLMs in domain-specific tasks requiring factual precision. This makes RAG particularly suitable for license compatibility analysis, where nuanced interpretations and accurate citations are essential for compliance.

The application of LLMs to legal text analysis has gained significant momentum. Chalkidis et al. \cite{chalkidis2020legal} evaluated transformer-based models on legal NLP tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness for legal information extraction. Zheng et al. \cite{zheng2021does} specifically examined LLMs for license classification, achieving high accuracy but noting challenges with novel or rare licenses.

The emergence of larger, more capable models has further improved performance. Henderson et al. \cite{henderson2022legal} showed that GPT-based models can extract legally relevant entities and relationships from complex documents. These capabilities form the foundation of our approach to parsing custom licenses and integrating them into a knowledge graph.

\subsection{Comprehensive Comparison}

Table~\ref{tab:comprehensive_comparison} presents a detailed comparison of existing license compatibility detection approaches across multiple dimensions including detection capabilities, compatibility analysis, explainability, and operational characteristics.

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:comprehensive_comparison}
\end{table*}

\subsection{Gap Analysis and Motivation}

Our analysis reveals several critical gaps in existing approaches:

\subsubsection{Limited Explainability}
Most tools provide binary compatibility decisions without detailed justification. LiDetector achieves 93.2\% accuracy but offers minimal explanation of its reasoning process, averaging only 0.8 citations per compatibility determination. This lack of transparency creates significant challenges for regulatory compliance, where audit trails and justification documentation are essential.

\subsubsection{Static Knowledge Representation}
Existing tools rely on static rule sets or trained models that require significant effort to update. FOSSology and ScanCode require manual rule updates, while LiDetector needs complete retraining for new license types. This static approach fails to accommodate the dynamic nature of software licensing, where new licenses emerge regularly and legal interpretations evolve.

\subsubsection{Narrow Compatibility Analysis}
Many tools focus primarily on license identification rather than comprehensive compatibility analysis. Of the tools surveyed, only LiDetector, FLICT, and ORT provide dedicated compatibility analysis capabilities, and even these are limited by static compatibility matrices or predefined rule sets.

\subsubsection{Custom License Limitations}
Enterprise environments often involve proprietary or custom licenses that existing tools cannot analyze effectively. Only our proposed approach provides automated parsing and integration of custom licenses into the compatibility analysis workflow.

\subsubsection{Integration Complexity}
While several tools offer enterprise features, their integration into CI/CD pipelines often requires significant configuration and maintenance overhead. The complexity of tools like ORT can create adoption barriers for smaller organizations or projects with limited compliance resources.

These limitations motivate our KG+LLM+RAG approach, which addresses each identified gap through: (1) comprehensive citation-backed explanations via RAG, (2) dynamic knowledge graph updates enabling rapid adaptation, (3) graph-based compatibility analysis supporting complex dependency chains, (4) LLM-powered custom license parsing, and (5) streamlined CI/CD integration with minimal configuration overhead.

\section{Proposed KG+LLM+RAG Framework}
\label{sec:our_approach}
We present \textit{Licenseer}, a framework that integrates \textbf{Knowledge Graphs}, \textbf{LLMs}, and \textbf{RAG} to overcome the limitations of existing approaches and support regulatory compliance. Figure~\ref{fig:overall_arch} illustrates the high-level architecture.

\begin{figure*}[!t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{licenseer_architecture.png}
    \caption{Proposed KG + LLM + RAG Architecture for License Compatibility and Regulatory Compliance. The framework integrates three key components: (1) A Neo4j-based knowledge graph that models licenses, dependencies, and their relationships; (2) An LLM-driven parser that extracts terms from custom licenses; and (3) A RAG module that retrieves relevant regulatory documents to ground explanations in authoritative sources.}
    \label{fig:overall_arch}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Knowledge Graph Construction}
Using Neo4j, our knowledge graph stores:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Licenses:} Nodes represent licenses (e.g., \emph{MIT}, \emph{GPLv3}, \emph{Apache-2.0}), including version details.
    \item \textbf{Dependencies:} Each OSS dependency is linked to a license node via a \texttt{HAS\_LICENSE} relationship.
    \item \textbf{Terms (Rights/Obligations):} Nodes for obligations (e.g., \emph{attribution}, \emph{distribution}) with relationships such as \texttt{REQUIRES}, \texttt{PROHIBITS}, and \texttt{PERMITS}.
    \item \textbf{Compatibility Edges:} Encodes relationships like \texttt{COMPATIBLE\_WITH} or \texttt{INCOMPATIBLE\_WITH} to enable traceability and impact analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
\label{sec:data_acquisition}

Our system relies on comprehensive and accurate license data to function effectively. We implemented a multi-stage process to collect, process, and structure license information:

\subsubsection{License Data Collection}
We developed a specialized web scraper using Selenium to extract license data from authoritative sources:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Primary Source:} The Open Source Initiative (OSI) website, which maintains the canonical versions of approved open-source licenses.
    \item \textbf{Secondary Sources:} SPDX specifications, GitHub's license API, and license compatibility matrices from established research.
    \item \textbf{Collection Metrics:} We successfully acquired 95+ distinct license types, with full text and metadata for each.
\end{itemize}

For each license, we extracted rich metadata including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item License name, SPDX identifier, and version information
    \item Approval date and submitting organization
    \item License steward and official URL
    \item License category (permissive, copyleft, etc.)
    \item Full license text for semantic analysis
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Knowledge Graph Population}
The collected license data was structured in a Neo4j graph database using a comprehensive schema designed to capture the complex relationships inherent in software licensing. The schema includes license nodes with extended metadata encompassing SPDX identifiers, categorization information, approval dates, and steward organizations.

Package nodes represent software components and include comprehensive metadata such as dependency relationships, repository information, and usage statistics. The relationship types between licenses and packages are carefully designed to capture different aspects of license application, including direct licensing relationships, compatibility assertions, and conditional permissions.

The graph currently contains over 95 license nodes with complete metadata, more than 10,000 package nodes from major software repositories, 12,000+ licensing relationships, and 8,000+ compatibility relationships derived from verified compatibility matrices and expert analysis.

This rich graph structure enables efficient traversal for compatibility checking, with query response times optimized through strategic indexing and relationship modeling. The graph design supports both simple compatibility lookups and complex multi-hop reasoning across dependency chains.

\subsection{RAG Implementation Details}
\label{sec:rag_implementation}

Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation system enhances LLM responses with contextually relevant license information. The implementation consists of several key components:

\subsubsection{Document Processing Pipeline}
License documents undergo a specialized processing pipeline:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Chunking:} License texts are split into semantic chunks using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with a chunk size of 512 tokens and 50-token overlap.
    \item \textbf{Metadata Preservation:} Each chunk maintains its source license metadata (SPDX ID, name, category) for traceability.
    \item \textbf{Embedding Generation:} OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model generates 1,536-dimensional vectors for each chunk.
    \item \textbf{Vector Indexing:} FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) creates an efficient index for nearest-neighbor retrieval.
\end{enumerate}

This process resulted in approximately 4,200 indexed chunks across all licenses, enabling fine-grained semantic retrieval.

\subsubsection{Retrieval Enhancement}
We implemented several techniques to improve retrieval quality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Context Window Optimization:} License-specific prompts direct the LLM to focus on compatibility aspects.
    \item \textbf{Contextual Compression:} An embeddings filter with a 0.7 similarity threshold removes irrelevant retrieved documents.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Retrieval:} Graph-based exact matches complement semantic search for higher precision.
    \item \textbf{Citation Tracking:} Retrieved chunks maintain source attribution for transparent explanations.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Integration with Knowledge Graph}
The RAG system interfaces with the Neo4j knowledge graph through a bidirectional workflow:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Query Enhancement:} Graph-derived license relationships inform RAG queries for better context.
    \item \textbf{Results Verification:} RAG-retrieved information is validated against graph relationships.
    \item \textbf{Explanation Augmentation:} License relationships from the graph provide structural context to RAG-generated explanations.
\end{itemize}

This integration produces explanations that combine the factual accuracy of graph-based relationships with the rich context of license text chunks, resulting in a 92.8\% retrieval precision rate and a 3.2x increase in citation accuracy compared to LiDetector.

\subsection{LLM-Driven Scraping and Parsing}
\label{sec:llm_parsing}
\textbf{Custom License Integration:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A scraping module collects license texts from GitHub, official websites, or internal documents.
    \item An LLM (e.g., GPT-based) parses these texts to extract obligations, restrictions, and version-specific clauses.
    \item The extracted insights are incorporated into the KG as new nodes and relationships, ensuring the system remains extensible and up to date.
\end{itemize}

For license parsing, we employ structured prompt templates that guide the LLM to identify and categorize legal obligations systematically. The parsing process focuses on extracting obligations (requirements that users must fulfill), prohibitions (actions that users cannot perform), permissions (rights granted to users), and version-specific clauses that may affect compatibility determinations.

This approach enables dynamic incorporation of new licenses without requiring model retraining, addressing a key limitation of existing rule-based tools. The extracted legal concepts are automatically integrated into the knowledge graph using predefined relationship templates, ensuring consistent representation across different license types.

\subsection{RAG for Explainability}
\label{sec:rag_section}
Our \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Generation} module supports explainability by:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Document Retrieval:} Embedding and indexing official license texts, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidelines for semantic search.
    \item \textbf{Explanation Generation:} Utilizing the LLM to generate context-rich explanations with direct citations from the retrieved documents.
\end{enumerate}

The RAG implementation follows a systematic process that begins with query analysis to understand the specific compatibility question being asked. The system generates semantic embeddings for the query and searches the vector store for the most relevant document chunks. Retrieved documents undergo relevance filtering and ranking to identify the most pertinent information sources.

Context assembly combines the selected document chunks with metadata about their sources and relevance scores. The language model then generates explanations that synthesize the retrieved information while maintaining clear attribution to source materials. This process ensures that all explanations are grounded in authoritative legal sources and can be independently verified.

\subsection{Query Flow and CI/CD Integration}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Query:} A developer inquires, \emph{``Can I combine MongoDB (SSPL) with Redis Stack (RSAL) for commercial use?''}
    \item \textbf{Entity Extraction (LLM):} The system extracts \emph{MongoDB} $\rightarrow$ \emph{SSPL} and \emph{Redis Stack} $\rightarrow$ \emph{RSAL}.
    \item \textbf{Cypher Query Generation:} A query is formulated for Neo4j to check for compatibility or conflicts between SSPL and RSAL.
    \item \textbf{Graph Traversal:} The system identifies direct or inferred incompatibilities via relationships in the KG.
    \item \textbf{RAG Explanation:} Relevant clauses are retrieved, and a detailed, citation-backed explanation is generated.
    \item \textbf{Integration:} The pipeline can be integrated into CI/CD workflows to monitor compliance continuously, flagging potential issues as dependencies or licenses change.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experimental Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

To evaluate our framework, we conducted a comprehensive assessment using both quantitative metrics and qualitative case studies.

\subsection{Dataset Construction}
We compiled a dataset of 2,000 OSS projects from GitHub, selected to represent diverse domains, sizes, and license types. The dataset includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 500 projects from each of the following domains: web development, machine learning, system utilities, and developer tools
    \item License distribution: 42\% permissive (MIT, Apache, BSD), 31\% copyleft (GPL variants, AGPL), 18\% weak copyleft (LGPL, MPL), and 9\% other/custom licenses
    \item Project size ranging from small libraries (< 1,000 LOC) to large frameworks (> 100,000 LOC)
\end{itemize}

For each project, we extracted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary license(s) from LICENSE files
    \item Dependencies and their licenses from package manifests (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt)
    \item Custom license terms and modifications through manual inspection
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We assessed our framework using the following metrics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{License Detection Accuracy}: Percentage of correctly identified licenses compared to ground truth.
    \item \textbf{Conflict Detection (F1)}: Harmonic mean of precision and recall in identifying license conflicts.
    \item \textbf{False Positive Rate (FPR)}: Percentage of compatibility cases incorrectly flagged as conflicts.
    \item \textbf{Explainability Score}: Manual evaluation on a 1-5 scale by three legal experts, assessing the quality, accuracy, and helpfulness of explanations.
    \item \textbf{Update Latency}: Time required to incorporate new license versions into the system.
\end{itemize}

The explainability score was calculated using the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1}: Minimal or incorrect explanation
    \item \textbf{2}: Basic explanation without citations
    \item \textbf{3}: Correct explanation with limited citations
    \item \textbf{4}: Detailed explanation with appropriate citations
    \item \textbf{5}: Comprehensive explanation with precise citations and actionable insights
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparative Analysis}
We compared our KG+RAG framework against LiDetector on identical datasets. For each system, we:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Ran compatibility checks on all possible license pairs in our dataset
    \item Evaluated the generated explanations against expert assessments
    \item Measured processing time and resource utilization
    \item Tested adaptation to new licenses by introducing 10 custom/modified licenses
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
Our implementation uses the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Knowledge Graph}: Neo4j (v4.4) with Cypher query language
    \item \textbf{LLM}: OpenAI GPT-4 for license parsing and explanation generation
    \item \textbf{Vector Database}: Chroma for document embedding and retrieval
    \item \textbf{Document Processing}: LangChain for document chunking and embedding
    \item \textbf{CI/CD Integration}: GitHub Actions and Jenkins pipelines
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Superior Explainability:} RAG-based explanations (4.8/5) significantly outperform traditional approaches, providing citation-backed reasoning
    \item \textbf{Rapid Adaptability:} Graph-based architecture enables 24-hour update cycles versus 168 hours for ML-based approaches
    \item \textbf{Resource Efficiency:} Maintains low memory usage (0.32GB) despite comprehensive capabilities
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Excellence:} Achieves 94\% compliance score, significantly exceeding existing approaches.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Our work demonstrates that integrating Knowledge Graphs with LLM-driven parsing and RAG not only improves license compatibility detection but also supports regulatory compliance by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enabling Traceability:} The KG provides a transparent map of licensing relationships, crucial for change impact analysis.
    \item \textbf{Facilitating Continuous Compliance:} The system's ability to integrate into CI/CD pipelines ensures ongoing adherence to both licensing and regulatory requirements.
    \item \textbf{Providing Detailed Explanations:} RAG-based explanations, with direct citations, help stakeholders understand compliance decisions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
While our system's performance is dependent on the quality of LLM parsing and the completeness of our document corpus, its extensibility and adaptability make it a robust solution for the dynamic regulatory landscape in software engineering.

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We presented \textbf{Licenseer}, a KG+LLM+RAG framework for automated license compatibility detection and regulatory compliance. Our comprehensive evaluation against existing approaches demonstrates significant advantages:

\textbf{Technical Achievements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Superior Accuracy:} 98.1\% license detection accuracy and 96.2\% conflict detection F1 score, outperforming both academic and commercial baselines
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Explainability:} RAG-generated, citation-backed explanations (4.8/5 score) significantly exceed traditional approaches
    \item \textbf{Rapid Adaptability:} 24-hour update cycles versus 168 hours for ML-based approaches
    \item \textbf{Resource Efficiency:} 0.32GB memory usage with comprehensive analysis capabilities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Regulatory Impact:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 94\% regulatory compliance score versus 65-78\% for existing approaches
    \item Structured knowledge representation enabling traceability and audit support
    \item Seamless CI/CD integration for continuous compliance monitoring
    \item Citation-backed explanations supporting legal decision-making
\end{itemize}

Our framework addresses critical gaps in license compatibility detection: limited explainability in existing tools, static knowledge representation requiring manual updates, narrow compatibility analysis focus, and poor custom license handling. The KG+LLM+RAG integration provides dynamic knowledge updates, comprehensive dependency analysis, and automated custom license parsing.

\textbf{Future Work:} We plan to extend coverage to emerging license formats, integrate additional package managers, develop regulatory framework-specific policies (GDPR, CCPA), and create industry-specific knowledge graphs for domain-specific compliance requirements.
